## Niels Emmer
Father, Husband, IT Architect

Creative, adaptive, engaged and committed to deliver. Driven by new knowledge and getting the best out of people and technology, I find happiness in building things that last.

A strong background in IT and exposure to a wide range of environments allows me to get the bigger picture. Experience from work in engineering, consulting and management rols allows me to build and execute.
